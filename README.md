#  Front-End technical challenge: Coding exercise - #tag function

<img src="https://github.com/kristinamartinkevich/tag-input/blob/main/src/assets/preview.png" alt="preview" width="250" />


Write a #tag function and implement it in an input text area or other object managing text. The resulting field should:

1. lookup and suggest #tags from the list below while typing
2. format the tags in a different style/color
3. format also new tags not existing in the list

You're free to use any framework or library you find online (so far we've not been able to find any which does this well out of the box). Make sure to test so that the behavior is what you expect. Use common sense and try twitter's equivalent tweet-field if in doubt regarding behavior (see screenshot from twitter above)

The point is not perfect functionality, but rather you showcasing how you address the problem, structure your code and build something with potential to become perfect and maintainable long term.

Final words
●	We are aware of the limitations of remote technical challenges and we are not looking for the perfect solution. We use this challenge to assess your reasoning, design skills and SW development processes.
●	We know life is busy and finding time for technical challenges is often difficult. Hence, there is no deadline from our side but obviously the sooner you deliver the solution the better. 
●	We are really grateful for your interest in Collective Minds and the effort you spend on this challenge.
